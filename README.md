# ISOM 3900: Monopoly decision making
Monopoly is a universally adored family game. What are some of the optimal strategies to win this game? In this project we have investigated optimal decision making strategies in monopoly through ANOVA, game theory, and Markov chain. 


### Python Simulation:
Simulation results were used in ANOVA and game theory methods. [Link](monopoly_simulation.ipynb)

### Markov Chain implementaion
- Implementing markov chain, Finding the transition matrix and steady state probability. [Link](monopoly_markov.ipynb)
- Failed excel implementation of markov chain. [Link](financials/MarkovExcelImplementation.xlsx)
- Calculate expected returns in excel. [Link](financials/MarkovChainFinancials.xlsx)
- Graphs for expected returns of tiles. (expected returns were calculated from [excel](financials/MarkovChainFinancials.xlsx).  [Link](finances_markov.ipynb)
